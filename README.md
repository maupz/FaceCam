# Face Detection and Smile Detection

This repository contains Python scripts for face detection and smile detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Haar cascades XML files (provided in the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

## Usage

2. Run the `faceCam.py` script:
```bash
python faceCam.py
```

3. The script will open a webcam feed and detect faces in real-time. It will also highlight detected faces with rectangles and display "Smile" if a smile is detected within a face.

4. Press 'q' to quit the script.

## Haar Cascades

This repository includes pre-trained Haar cascade XML files for face detection and smile detection. You can find these files in the `local` directory.
